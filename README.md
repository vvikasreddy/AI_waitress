# AI_waitress

### How to Replicate the Environment

To set up the environment for this project, you’ll need Anaconda installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Model Repository**:
   - Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:vvikasreddy/AI_waitress.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open the Anaconda Prompt (available after installing Anaconda).
   - Navigate to the cloned repository’s directory (e.g., `cd AI_waitress`).
   - Run these commands to create and activate the environment:
     ```
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate verbi
     ```
   - The first command creates the environment using the `environment.yaml` file, and the second activates it, switching you to the `verbi` environment.

**Note**: Anaconda must be installed beforehand. Download it from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) if you haven’t already.
